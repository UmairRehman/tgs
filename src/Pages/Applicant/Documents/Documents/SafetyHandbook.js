                      Dear New Employee:
                      <br />
                      <br />
                      I welcome you to Trans-Global Solutions, Inc. (TGS). At
                      TGS we are committed to safety and providing you with a
                      safe and healthy work environment. As part of our
                      commitment, our management staff will ensure that you
                      receive the guidance and direction you need to help you
                      become a productive and safety conscious member of our
                      workforce.
                      <br />
                      <br />
                      Because of our Teamwork approach, we believe that all of
                      our employees must participate in maintaining a safe work
                      place. This Employee Safety Handbook has been developed to
                      demonstrate our commitment to your safety and to inform
                      you of general safety rules and policies TGS has
                      established as part of your safety orientation.
                      <br />
                      <br />
                      As a condition of your employment with Trans-Global
                      Solutions, Inc., all employees are required to follow all
                      company safety policies, procedures, practices, rules,
                      orders, regulations and standards established by our
                      Safety Department, not only for your protection, but in
                      order to comply with regulatory safety requirements.
                      Should you discover an unsafe condition that would affect
                      you or your fellow employee, immediately contact your
                      supervisor or Site Safety Coordinator.
                      <br />
                      <br />
                      As a TGS employee, you are required to immediately report
                      to your supervisor and/or designated Site Safety
                      Coordinator, any injury or illness that occurs while
                      performing your assigned duties. Should you experience an
                      occupational injury or illness, our supervisors will make
                      sure that you receive immediate and appropriate medical
                      care necessary to treat you and help you on your way to
                      recovery.
                      <br />
                      <br />
                      At TGS, we believe our employees are valuable and
                      essential for our growth and prosperity. Therefore, our
                      commitment to your safety, and investment in your
                      individual growth, is paramount.
                      <br />
                      <br />
                      This handbook provides a fundamental overview of safety
                      rules and practices that make up a brief, but essential,
                      part of our total health and safety program. Use this
                      handbook as your reference guide concerning your health
                      and safety. Should you have any questions concerning your
                      safety and security, contact your designated Site Safety
                      Coordinator or the TGS Safety Department.
                      <br />
                      <br />
                      Safety should not be considered a switch that we turn on
                      when we come to work and turn off when we go home, but
                      rather a personal commitment for a better way of life for
                      you and those close to you. Apply safe work habits at the
                      beginning of your every thought and action, whether at
                      work or play. You will be glad you did. Good luck and be
                      safe.
                      <br />
                      <br />
                      <br />
                      Sincerely,
                      <br />

                      Hammers: Use a hammer only if it is in good condition with
                      the head firmly attached to the handle. Defective hammers
                      should be repaired or replaced prior to use. Grip the
                      handle close to the end to ensure an effective blow.
                      Hammer handles are intended for gripping; do not use them
                      as pry bar or for light tapping. Do not use a wrench, rod,
                      bolt or other tool as a hammer. Never strike hardened
                      objects, such as a wrench, file or another hammer, with
                      anything except a rawhide or soft-metal hammer.

                      <br />
                      Pliers: Pliers are to be used according to their design;
                      gripping an cutting. Never use pliers for loosening or
                      tightening nuts or bolts. Always use a wrench for nuts and
                      bolts. For firm grip with minimum effort pliers should be
                      as nearly parallel as possible. Pliers that cut wire with
                      one hand should always be chosen.
                      <br />
                      <br />
                      Wrenches: The proper wrench, or adequate size, should be
                      chosen for the job, i.e. pipe, crescent, open end, box
                      end, socket, etc. Wrenches should be inspected frequently
                      for deterioration. Repair or replace damaged wrenches
                      prior to use. Wrenches should not be used as hammers.
                      Always replace worn jaws with new ones. Jaw teeth should
                      be kept sharp and clean.
                      <br />
                      <br />
                      If leverage with a small wrench is insufficient, a larger,
                      stronger wrench should be obtained. Snipes or cheaters
                      should not be used with small wrenches, but with larger
                      wrenches designed to accommodate their use. Always makes
                      sure the wrench has a firm hold prior to applying weight
                      against it. Feet should be positioned so that balance is
                      maintained when the joint or fitting loosens or the wrench
                      slips. A wrench should always be pulled toward the open
                      jaws rather than away as this helps tighten the grip and
                      prevents the jaws from spreading. A fixed jaw or an
                      adjustable wrench is stronger than a movable jaw wrench.

                      Screwdrivers: A Screwdriver handle should be smooth and
                      undamaged but not slippery. The side of the shank should
                      be straight and exactly parallel to fit the slot in the
                      screw head. The end of the screwdriver bit should be at an
                      exact right angle. The accuracy of fit between the bit and
                      the screw head should be a close fit, whether it is the
                      standard Slotted or Phillips Head type. Never use a
                      screwdriver as a chisel or pry bar. Do not use a
                      screwdriver with a worn, chipped or broken tip. Keep the
                      bit filed square, following the original taper line. Use a
                      screwdriver with an insulated handle for electrical work.
                      <br />
                      <br />
                      Files: Always equip files with tight fitting handles prior
                      to use, as the end of the tang is very sharp. Whenever
                      possible, clamp the part to be filed in a vise. File teeth
                      are made to cut in one direction in a forward motion.
                      Never use a file for prying as the body of the file is
                      brittle and a slight bending force will snap it. Never use
                      a file as a chisel.
                      <br />
                      <br />
                      Chisels: Choose the appropriate sized chisel for the job
                      and choose a hammer large enough for the chisel. Select a
                      chisel with a cutting edge the same width or wider than
                      the cut required. Keep the cutting edge of the chisel
                      sharp and shaped according to the cut to be made. Never
                      use mushroomed-shaped heads as flying chips may occur.
                      Heads should be dressed as soon as they begin to crack.
                      Never use a wood chisel without a handle. Hold a chisel
                      between thumb and forefinger, palm up, keeping the
                      knuckles out of the way. Do not attempt to hold a chisel
                      if the hands are numb with cold. Always chisel away from
                      the body. Always wear eye protection while using a chisel.
                      <br />
                      <br />
                      Power Tool: Typical injuries from power tools include, but
                      are not limited to, burns, cuts, strains, electrical
                      shock, and eye particles, fires, falls and gas explosions.
                      A tool should never be left overhead as the cords may be
                      pulled causing the tool to fall. Cords and lines should be
                      kept out of the trafficked area and away from oil, hot
                      surfaces and chemicals. A trip on a cord or line could tug
                      on the cord, causing a tool to jam, and exposing the
                      operator and others to injury.
                      <br />
                      <br />
                      Ground portable electric tools are the best way to
                      eliminate electric shock. Do not stand in water when using
                      a power tool, even if it is grounded. The thee-way plug
                      and receptacle is the best method of grounding. Use ground
                      fault interrupter receptacles, or ground fault interrupter
                      circuit breakers, whenever a power source is tapped.
                      <br />
                      <br />
                      Electrical cords should be inspected prior to use and kept
                      in good condition. Always use heavy-duty plugs that clap
                      to the cord to prevent a strain on the conductors. Always
                      pull the plug, not the cord. Protect all powered tools
                      against sharp objects, heat and oil.
                      <br />
                      <br />
                      If an electrical drill is dropped, eyes may be struck by
                      flying debris. Although drill bits do not have guards,
                      some protection can be obtained from carefully chosen
                      bits. Electric saws are well guarded and should never be
                      jammed or crowded into the material being cut. Always
                      choose saws equipped with a trigger switch, which shuts
                      off the power once pressure is released.
                      <br />
                      <br />
                      Use dust goggles or plastic face shields whenever grinding
                      wheels, buffers and brushes are used.
                      <br />
                      <br />
                      Never use electric motor driven tools in any gaseous
                      atmosphere as an explosion may occur.

                      Most jobs will have some exposure to electricity. You may
                      be working with an electrical tool or machine, or simply
                      plugging a light or extension cord into an outlet. These
                      are everyday activities you do at home as well as work.
                      Remember, though, that electricity ALWAYS deserves special
                      attention and caution. An accident with electricity can be
                      one of the most serious. A single mistake with an
                      electrical tool, plug, cord or circuit can kill you. This

                      <br />
                      1. Make sure your footing is firm and check the pathway to
                      be sure itâs clear of trip and sliphazards or
                      obstructions.

                      2. Lift with the strong muscles in your leg muscles, NOT
                      with your weaker back muscles.Keep your back as straight
                      as possible. DO NOT lean over to lift. Turn by moving
                      yourfeet, NOT by twisting your body.

                      as close to your body as possible asyou gradually
                      straighten your legs to a standing position. Try to keep

                      The Company maintains a manual containing the written

                      zoneâ. An indicator needle pointing out of the green area
                      (into the red) means that there may be too little or too
                      much pressure. All extinguishers require maintenance and
                      servicing. The pin should also be in place and secured
                      with a plastic seal.

                      Notify your Supervisor and designated Site Safety
                      Coordinator about any fire extinguisher that has been
                      used. Arrangements will be made to have it serviced. If an
                      extinguisher is used even a little, it may continue to
                      leak pressure. Over a few days, the pressure can discharge
                      and the extinguisher will be unusable. Letâs keep out fire
                      extinguishers ready for when we might need them the most.

                      Despite all precautions, there always is the possibility
                      of fire, chemical spills, serious weather conditions or
                      other forms of emergencies that can occur within the
                      workplace that may necessitate an emergency evacuation.
                      Consequently, it is necessary to have an evacuation plan
                      that everyone understands. The Emergency Evacuation Plan
                      designates escape routes from each work area. These are
                      routes for getting outside and into a safe area the
                      quickest and most direct manner. Evacuation routes are
                      posted on maps throughout the workplace.

                      In an evacuation, all Employees should report to their

                      area, make sure that you are a safe distance away. Remain
                      in the gathering area so that a head count can be taken.
                      The head count will ensure that al on-duty personnel have
                      been accounted for.
